# Volatility-Gated Sentiment Strategy Analysis Summary

## Key Finding: Sentiment Signals Have Limited Predictive Power

### Cherry-Picking Analysis Results
Our comprehensive analysis to find "cherry-picking but standard practice" ways to make sentiment useful revealed:

1. **LOW VOLATILITY + SENTIMENT**: 0.22 correlation in lowest 20% volatility periods
2. **Contrarian on extreme negative sentiment**: 0.82% mean return
3. **Monthly effects**: December shows 0.14 correlation

### Implementation Results

#### Strategy Design
Based on the promising correlation in low volatility periods, we implemented a volatility-gated ensemble strategy that:
- Trades only during low volatility periods (bottom 40%)
- Uses sentiment signals when meta-model confidence is moderate (>45%)
- Applies contrarian logic on extreme sentiment

#### Performance Metrics

| Strategy | Coverage | Accuracy | Sharpe Ratio |
|----------|----------|----------|--------------|
| Baseline LSTM | 100% | 37.5% | -4.10 |
| Filtered | 0% | 0% | 0.00 |
| Selective | 26% | 32% | -6.13 |
| Contrarian | 100% | 36.5% | -4.47 |
| **Volatility-Gated** | **21.9%** | **23.8%** | **-9.76** |

### Why the Strategy Failed

1. **Meta-Model Calibration Issues**
   - Mean confidence: 44.5%
   - Only 3/96 samples have confidence >60%
   - Low and high volatility periods don't align with high confidence

2. **Sparse Sentiment Data**
   - Only 14/96 test samples have non-zero sentiment
   - Sentiment signals are too infrequent to be actionable

3. **Overfitting to Historical Patterns**
   - The 0.22 correlation found in training data doesn't generalize
   - Test period shows inverse relationship (worse than random)

### Diagnostic Findings

```
Trading Conditions Analysis:
- Low volatility samples: 19
- High confidence samples: 3  
- Overlap (both conditions): 0

With Relaxed Thresholds:
- Low volatility (<40th): 38 samples
- Moderate confidence (>45%): 47 samples
- Overlap: 21 samples (resulting in 21.9% coverage)
```

### Volatility Characteristics When Trading
- Mean volatility when trading: 0.0118
- Mean volatility overall: 0.0247
- **52.2% volatility reduction achieved**
- Concentrated in March-April period only

## Conclusions

### What Works
1. **Volatility filtering is effective**: Successfully reduces volatility by 52%
2. **The framework is sound**: Meta-model architecture works correctly
3. **Cherry-picking identified real patterns**: But they don't generalize

### What Doesn't Work
1. **Sentiment signals lack predictive power**: Correlations <0.1 in most cases
2. **Meta-model can't reliably predict LSTM accuracy**: Base rate too low (37.5%)
3. **Contrarian strategies fail**: Market doesn't systematically overreact to sentiment

### Practical Recommendations

1. **Don't use sentiment for carbon trading**: The signals are too weak and sparse
2. **Focus on technical indicators**: LSTM without sentiment is more reliable
3. **Volatility filtering alone might help**: But needs different decision logic
4. **Need more frequent sentiment data**: Current data is too sparse (14% coverage)

### The Cherry-Picking Reality

While we found "standard practice" approaches (volatility filtering, contrarian strategies, monthly seasonality), the underlying sentiment signals are simply too weak to be useful for carbon market prediction. The best "cherry-picked" correlation of 0.22 in low volatility periods doesn't hold out-of-sample.

**Final Verdict**: Sentiment scores from policy documents don't provide actionable trading signals for carbon markets, even with sophisticated filtering and ensemble methods.
